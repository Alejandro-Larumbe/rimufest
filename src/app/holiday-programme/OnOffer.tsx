            RimuFest is committed to making chamber music education accessible
            to all students. A limited number of scholarships are available for
            those who would not be able to attend the programme without
            financial assistance. These may be full or partial and are open to
            all applicants.

            Priority will be given to students applying from outside Tauranga
            due to the additional costs associated with travel and
            accommodation. Tauranga-based students are still welcome to apply
            and will be considered if funding permits.
          </li>

            If you are experiencing genuine financial hardship, you may indicate
            this on your registration form to be considered for a scholarship.
