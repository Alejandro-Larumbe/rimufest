          grouped with others at a similar level and provided with appropriately
          challenging music. Violinists also have the option to customize their
          experience by including violin and/or viola studies.

          series that showcases and promotes both local and national talent.
          These concerts feature works by New Zealand and international
          composers, celebrating diverse voices and cultures. The series
          contributes to the growth and appreciation of the arts in the Bay of
