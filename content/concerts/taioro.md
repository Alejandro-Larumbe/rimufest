description: "TAIORO is the newest ensemble in Aotearoa, in fact so new that its appearance at RimuFest will be its first public event. Bringing together an acclaimed Maori spoken word poet, with violist Donald Maurice and cellist Inbal Megiddo. They will be joined for this concert by guest violinist Amelia Taylor in a fascinating programme ranging from Beethoven through to three of Aotearoa's most significant composers. With Alfred Hill born in 1869, Douglas Lilburn born in 1915, and Anthony Ritchie from the baby boomer years, this is a collage of the country's entire western classical music history. Interwoven with the poetry of Sharn Maree Cassady this will be an evening to remember.

All proceeds are reinvested for the following year to bring Tauranga more concerts and events like these and to help continue supporting the growth of young Tauranga musicians.  Book your tickets now. *DOOR SALES: CASH ONLY*"
