          What to expect at RimuFest
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 text-pink">Ensemble/Orchestra</h3>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          During RimuFest, students will play as members of a large group led
          and directed by Alejandro Larumbe. They will be divided into sections
          of the same instrument, sharing the same music. Each section supports
          one another, fostering synchronization and a unified sound. Playing
          the same music together nurtures teamwork, develops listening, and how
          to follow the conductor. It develops musicality and ensemble skills,
          blending individual parts harmoniously. Ensemble participation
          cultivates unity and collaboration among students, working towards a
          shared goal of creating a beautiful performance. These techniques and
          skills taught by the director prepare students for their small chamber
          ensembles, where they will take on leadership roles and play one
          student per part.

        <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 text-pink">Chamber music</h3>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          During a RimuFest Programme, each student will be placed into a small
          chamber music group consisting of 2-5 players, where they will be the
          sole player of their assigned part. It is crucial for each student to
          know their music beforehand, as missing parts can disrupt the
          ensemble's cohesion. Students will have dedicated time with a teacher
          to develop their skills in playing as a group. The RimuFest faculty
          will provide coaching and guidance to the chamber music groups
          throughout the program.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          Participating in chamber music is highly beneficial, supportive, and
          enjoyable. It allows students to refine fundamental skills like
          rhythm, pitch, timing, and dynamics. Additionally, chamber music
          fosters creative thinking, coordination, memorization, as well as
          social and emotional skills. It is a rewarding experience that helps
          students enhance their overall musicianship and ensemble playing
          abilities.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 text-pink">Technique class</h3>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          A string technique class focuses on developing essential skills for
          string instrument players. It covers areas such as proper posture,
          bowing techniques, left-hand finger placement, intonation, tone
          production, scales, etudes, and musical expression. The class aims to
          improve technical proficiency and musicianship for a well-rounded
          playing experience. -This class is only part of the Holiday programme

        <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 text-pink">Rehearsal vs Coaching</h3>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          A rehearsal in chamber music is a practice session where the members
          of the group come together to play and work on the music without the
          presence of a teacher. Each student comes prepared with their
          individual part, and they collaborate as a team to put the music
          together. During rehearsals, the focus is on developing teamwork,
          communication, and musical understanding among the group members. They
          work on musical elements such as dynamics, phrasing, and
          interpretation, with each student taking responsibility for their part
          while listening and responding to others.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          A coaching session is led by one of RimuFest's experienced teachers.
          The coach works closely with the chamber group, providing guidance and
          feedback to help them refine their performance. Coaches offer valuable
          insights into musical interpretation, technique, and overall
          musicality. They may suggest specific rehearsal techniques and offer
          suggestions on how to improve the sound and cohesion of the ensemble.
          Unlike rehearsals, where the focus is on the collaborative efforts of
          the group, coaching sessions are more instructional and led by the
          teacher.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          Both rehearsals and coachings play crucial roles in the development of
          young musicians in chamber music. Rehearsals foster teamwork and
          independence among the students, while coachings provide expert
          guidance and direction to enhance their musical skills and performance
          quality. Together, these elements contribute to a well-rounded and
          enriching chamber music experience at RimuFest.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 text-pink">Masterclass</h3>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          A masterclass is a valuable and integral part of RimuFest's programme,
          held at the end of each day. During the masterclass, students have the
          opportunity to perform their music in front of all their peers and
          faculty members. This session allows them to receive valuable feedback
          on their performance, with the teachers providing insights into what
          is working well and areas that may need improvement. The masterclass
          is a supportive and nurturing environment where students can learn
          from each other's performances and receive helpful rehearsal
          techniques to take to their next practice session.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          In addition to refining their musical performance, students also work
          on the overall presentation on stage. They learn about body language,
          how to walk on and off stage, and how to engage with the audience
          through public speaking. These skills are essential for a well-rounded
          and confident performance and help the students become more polished
          and expressive musicians.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          The masterclass is an enriching experience for the students, as it not
          only enhances their musical skills but also instills valuable stage
          presence and confidence. It provides a safe space for them to learn
          and grow as performers, preparing them for future musical endeavors
          and helping them shine on stage.

        <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 text-pink">Viola for violinists</h3>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          At RimuFest, we offer violinists the opportunity to learn the viola.
          We welcome participants with little or no experience in the viola and
          encourage their exploration of this instrument.

        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          All string instruments play significant roles in music. In chamber and
          orchestral settings, the viola acts as the link between melody and
          harmony, contributing inner harmonies and rhythmic figures while also
          having moments to shine.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
          With similar playing techniques as the violin, violinists can easily
          adapt to the deep and warm-sounding viola. Learning both instruments
          brings multiple benefits, improving technique on the violin and
          providing opportunities to experience different roles in chamber and
          orchestral music.
